## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. A promising but largely underexplored area is their potential to facilitate human coordination with large numbers of agents. Such capabilities would be very useful in domains including disaster response, urban planning, and real-time strategy scenarios. In this work, we introduce a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities, alongside a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 1,500 agents using natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with the hybrid approach excelling in tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and infrastructure. However, our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans. This work sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in human-swarm coordination, paving the way for future research in this exciting area.
